Pros of NOT Enabling (Short-Term View),Cons of NOT Enabling (Long-Term Reality)
Deferred Costs: Delays capital expenditure and operational costs associated with infrastructure upgrades and migration efforts.,"Catastrophic Security Vulnerability: Exposes all sensitive company and customer data to ""harvest now, decrypt later"" attacks, leading to an inevitable and complete loss of confidentiality once a quantum computer is available."
"Maintain Status Quo: Avoids the complexity and potential disruption of migrating systems, applications, and processes in the immediate future.","Severe Reputational Damage: A quantum-related breach would lead to a catastrophic loss of customer trust, shareholder confidence, and irreparable brand damage."
Reduced Immediate Resource Allocation: Frees up IT and security personnel to focus on other current projects and priorities.,Significant Financial Penalties & Legal Liabilities: Non-compliance with future regulations and data protection laws will result in massive fines. Data breaches will lead to costly lawsuits.
"Simpler Vendor Management: No immediate need to pressure vendors for PQC roadmaps or evaluate new, potentially immature PQC products.","Loss of Competitive Advantage & Market Access: Inability to meet the security requirements of partners, customers, and government agencies, effectively locking the enterprise out of key markets."
No Training Overhead: Avoids the immediate need to train developers and IT staff on new cryptographic standards and protocols.,"Forced, Chaotic, and More Expensive Remediation: A reactive migration after the threat is mature (or after a breach) will be exponentially more complex, disruptive, and costly than a planned, proactive transition."
,"Talent Scarcity and Extreme Costs: The demand for PQC-skilled professionals will skyrocket, making it incredibly difficult and expensive to hire the necessary talent under duress."
